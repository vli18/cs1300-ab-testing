            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                A/B Testing is a method used to compare two versions of a web page or app to determine which one performs better. The overarching question we are attempting to prove/disprove is whether version A or version B of the webpage yields better results in terms of user engagement or conversion rates. A/B Testing helps make useful observations on the effectiveness of one design over another by randomly assigning users to either version A or version B and analyzing their interactions and behaviors.
