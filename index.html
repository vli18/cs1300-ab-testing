            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In this project, we perform an A/B test on two different UI designs for a health appointment booking webpage. 
                Version A is the provided original version of the webpage while Version B is an “improved” version utilizing a number 
                of UI design principles. Through this assignment, the question we are attempting to prove/disprove is whether the UI 
                changes made in Version B resulted in a statistically significant difference in user interaction compared to Version A. 
                Users are given a target interaction as a part of the A/B test and results are based on three chosen metrics from the 
                collected data points. Utilizing A/B testing, we make useful observations on the effectiveness of one design over another 
                through statistical tests and analyses. By quantitatively assessing the user interaction of the two versions based on metrics, 
                we are able to understand and confidently infer how specific design choices an impact the overall usability and effectiveness of the product.

                        A high chi-squared value indicates that the observed differences between groups are unlikely to occur by random chance. A chi-squared value of 4.147480638 suggests statistically significant results between the webpage versions.

            <h3>Summary Statistics</h3>
            <p>
                We collected nine metrics  for each version of the webpage. These data points quantify and categorize user interaction in relation to time and navigation that indicate different things about users’ journey of interaction with both versions of the webpage.
                
                <br><br>Based on the statistics from the three chosen metrics, it is likely that version B is better than version A.
                
                <br><br>We see that on average users spend 7015 more milliseconds on version A than on version B before completing the target 
                interaction, and analysis shows that it’s likely a true difference. The median time spent on page for Version A is 8526.5 milliseconds, 
                compared to 5466 milliseconds for Version B. Version A has a variance of 14060994 milliseconds, significantly higher than Version B's variance of 3481964.48 milliseconds. 
                These statistics suggest Version B offers a more efficient user experience, likely due to UI modifications that streamline navigation through chronological ordering of appointments by date.
                
                <br><br>We see that on average users move their mouse 1,953.2 pixels more on version A than on version B before completing the target interaction, 
                and analysis shows that it’s likely a true difference. The median mouse movement distance for Version A is 8526.5 pixels, while for Version B it is 5466 pixels. 
                Version A has a variance of 6401849 pixels, significantly different from Version B's variance of 183136 pixels. This indicates Version B's design 
                reduces mouse movement, likely due to aligned color choices that enforce clearer horizontal relationships between information and correspond buttons and vertical spacing.
                
                <br><br>We believe that the UI changes in button colors, textual hierarchy, and logical organization contribute to improved user experience in Version B, 
                as confidently supported by our A/B testing results.
