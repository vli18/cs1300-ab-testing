            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                In this project, we perform an A/B test on two different UI designs for a health appointment booking webpage. 
                Version A is the provided original version of the webpage while Version B is an “improved” version utilizing a number 
                of UI design principles. Through this assignment, the question we are attempting to prove/disprove is whether the UI 
                changes made in Version B resulted in a statistically significant difference in user interaction compared to Version A. 
                Users are given a target interaction as a part of the A/B test and results are based on three chosen metrics from the 
                collected data points. Utilizing A/B testing, we make useful observations on the effectiveness of one design over another 
                through statistical tests and analyses comparing the data of the two versions on the three metrics. By quantitatively 
                assessing the user interaction of the two versions, we are able to understand and confidently infer how design choices 
                can impact the overall usability and effectiveness of the product.
